# RotoBaller Scraping Analysis

## Summary

The RotoBaller fantasy football rankings page uses a JavaScript-heavy, Angular-based single-page application (SPA) that loads data dynamically after the initial page load. Traditional web scraping approaches (BeautifulSoup, pandas.read_html) cannot extract the rankings data because it's not present in the initial HTML response.

## Technical Findings

### Page Structure
- **Framework**: Angular SPA with `ng-app="rankingsApp"`
- **Container**: `<div class="ionutRankings mlb" ng-app="rankingsApp">`
- **Settings**: JavaScript variable `rtsSettings` with configuration:
  - `defaultSpreadsheet: 'half-ppr'`
  - `defaultPlayersPerPage: '100'`
  - `premiumCategories: ['premium']`

### Current Limitations
1. **No Static Tables**: The rankings data is not present in the initial HTML
2. **JavaScript Required**: Data is loaded via AJAX/API calls after page load
3. **Dynamic Content**: Content is rendered client-side by Angular

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Browser Automation (Recommended)
Use Selenium or Playwright to load the page and wait for JavaScript to execute:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

def scrape_with_browser():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get("https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-fantasy-football-rankings-tiered-ppr/265860")
    
    # Wait for rankings to load
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
    rankings_container = wait.until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".ionutRankings"))
    )
    
    # Extract data once loaded
    # Implementation needed based on rendered HTML structure
```

### 2. API Endpoint Discovery
The Angular app likely makes API calls to load rankings. Potential approaches:
- Browser developer tools to monitor network requests
- Look for API endpoints in JavaScript files
- Reverse engineer the Angular app's HTTP requests

### 3. Alternative Data Sources
Consider using other fantasy football data sources that provide:
- Static HTML tables
- Official APIs
- CSV/JSON exports

## Current Scraper Status

The `simple_rotoballer_scraper.py` successfully:
✅ Handles HTTP requests and compression
✅ Parses HTML content
✅ Identifies the SPA structure
✅ Provides debugging capabilities

But cannot:
❌ Extract rankings data (requires JavaScript execution)
❌ Access dynamically loaded content
❌ Parse the Angular application data

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**: Implement browser automation (Selenium/Playwright)
2. **For Development**: Use alternative data sources or existing APIs
3. **For Learning**: Study the existing `src/services/rotoballer_scrape_service.py` which may have solved this problem

## Next Steps

If you want to proceed with RotoBaller scraping, we should:
1. Add Selenium/Playwright to requirements.txt
2. Implement browser automation approach
3. Handle the dynamically rendered content
4. Extract data from the rendered tables
